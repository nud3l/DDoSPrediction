# DDoSPrediction
## TU Delft / IN4252
In this course each student had to find and select a research issue related to the Web. In the paper presented I looked at the possibility to predict politically motivated DDoS attacks based on Twitter in the UK. Therefore, I stored tweets from the UK for two weeks in a row and used unsupervised learning techniques to predict these attacks. Full details can be found in the [paper](IN4252_Paper_Dominik Harz.pdf).
